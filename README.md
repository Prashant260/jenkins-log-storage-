This project automates the process of uploading Jenkins build logs or artifacts to an AWS S3 bucket using a Jenkins pipeline and shell scripting. It is designed to enhance CI/CD workflows by enabling efficient and secure archival, sharing, or backup of Jenkins-generated files directly to Amazon S3.

#Shell Script Permissions (if scripting)

If using a shell script for uploads, ensure it has execution rights:


chmod 777 s3upload.sh
With all prerequisites fulfilled, youâ€™re ready to set up Jenkins pipelines that seamlessly upload build logs or artifacts to AWS S3 as part of your CI/CD process.
